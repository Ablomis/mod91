# F1Manager 2022 Texture Modding Guide
This is a guide to making changes to the texutres in the F1 Manager 2022 game.

## Requirements
- Fmodel: Easily check contents of game files: https://github.com/4sval/FModel/releases
- UE Viewer: Show and extract resources (3D models, textures etc.) from game files–ñ https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel
- Gimp: A free PhotoShop alternative for editing DDS files used by the game: https://www.gimp.org/downloads/
- Unreal Engine 4.27 (install it from the EPIC launcher)

## Preparing Modding Files
Follow Unpacking guide found [here](https://github.com/carefreeduck/F1ManagerModding/blob/main/Packing.md).

## Extracting the asset
If you don't want to alter the image but replace it completely - you can skip to the next session.
For the purpose of this tutorial we will use the OnboardingCgaracter.uasset.
Find the character .uasset file in the Fmodel, right click on t and select "Export Raw Data"

After that, open the image in the Umodel editor, making sure the right engine version is selected:

After that export the image. Make sure you are exporting as .dds - the checkbox is selected:

Ok, you are done for now, you can make any changes as you see fit using GIMP or other editor that can work with DDS files.

## Creating final DDS file
Whether you are editing an existing image o a new one make sure it is exported with **no compression** (8888 BRGA). Add mip maps if necessary. As a rule of thumb - mip maps are needed for images that will be used as textures for 3D models.

## Replacing the asset
Go to the Unreal editor and create a folder for your texture in the content folder. Then drag your .DDS texture there.
Make sure the name of the texture is **identical** to the .uasset file.

Go File-> Save All
Then File-> Cook content for Windows
The output files will be in the "Unreal Projects\MyProject\Saved\Cooked\WindowsNoEditor\MyProject\Content" directory

That's it! Now you can repack the cooked .uasset and .uexp files to the pak and enjoy the updated texture in game.
